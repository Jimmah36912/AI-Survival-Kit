**Live Demo:** [https://ai-survival-kit-577388719652.us-central1.run.app](https://ai-survival-kit-577388719652.us-central1.run.app )  
**Built for:** Google AI "Build Your Portfolio" Challenge (2026)

## 🌟 The Mission
The AI Survival Kit is a dual-component project designed to help workers at risk of AI job displacement. 
As a non-programmer building my first major project, my mission was to create a "lifeline" for people affected by automation,
moving them from a place of fear to a place of empowerment through education and AI-assisted tools.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Risk Assessment:** Personalized evaluations for 8 high-risk job roles.
- **AI Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides on how to use AI to enhance (not replace) human work.
- **Certificate Generation:** Motivational certificates to celebrate the start of the user's AI journey.
- **Chrome Extension Assistant:** A personal AI sidekick powered by Google Gemini that helps users summarize text and answer questions in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.0-pro`)
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run (Containerized with Docker)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (with custom animations), and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Browser Integration:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3

## ☁️ Google Cloud Integration
This project is fully hosted on **Google Cloud Run**. By using a containerized approach (Docker), the application is scalable, secure, and globally accessible.
The integration with the **Gemini API** allows for real-time, intelligent career coaching directly within the platform.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/`: Main Flask application and website files.
- `/chrome-extension`: Source code for the "AI Assistant" Chrome extension.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for the Google Cloud Run deployment.

## 👤 About the Author
I’m a builder and operator who saw a gap in how we talk about AI. Most people obsess over the what — I focus on the who: the people whose jobs are changing fast.
I built the AI Survival Kit to help anyone move from AI-threatened to AI-empowered with practical guidance.
It’s also my own build-in-public journey of learning Google Cloud Run and Gemini and turning that learning into a lifeline for others.
