**Built for:** Google AI "Build Your Portfolio" Challenge (2026)

## 🌟 The Mission
The AI Survival Kit is a mission-driven project designed to help workers at risk of AI job displacement. Built by a non-programmer, this project serves as a "Proof of Concept" that with the right tools, anyone can move from a place of fear to a place of empowerment.

## 🧠 My Journey: From “I Can’t Code” to “Wait… I Built That?”
Two weeks ago, I was watching AI headlines and thinking: *“Man… people are about to get blindsided.”* 

I’m not a programmer, but I’ve always been the type to learn fast when something matters. I went from asking *“What even is a terminal?”* to:
*   **Fighting with Docker:** Learning to containerize my mission for the cloud.
*   **Wiring up Gemini:** Integrating the `gemini-1.0-pro` model as a personal career coach.
*   **The Shipping Moment:** Seeing my project go live on a `.run.app` link. 

When it finally went live, I just sat there like… *Holy sh*t. This is real.* That’s what this kit is: a real build, from a real person, for real people.

## 🛠️ The Google Power Stack
I chose to centralize my entire stack within the Google ecosystem to avoid "subscription fatigue" and focus on impact:
*   **Gemini 1.0 Pro API:** The intelligent "brain" providing real-time coaching.
*   **Google AI Studio:** My prototyping lab for prompt engineering.
*   **Google Cloud Run:** The scalable, containerized home for the platform.
*   **Artifact Registry & Cloud Build:** Managing the DevOps and deployment pipeline.
*   **Cloud Console & SDK:** My centralized "Mission Control" for the entire project.

## ❤️ Why I Love the Google Ecosystem
What I appreciate most isn't just the power of the models—it's the **velocity**. The "Single Pane of Glass" experience across Google AI Studio and Cloud Run allowed me to stop worrying about the app's "plumbing" and focus 100% on the human mission. Google builds for the person who wants to move fast and solve real-world problems without the infrastructure overhead.

## 🚀 What's Next?
*   **Public Release:** Launching to a wider audience.
*   **Direct Download:** One-click install for the Chrome Extension.
*   **LinkedIn Analyzer:** A Gemini-powered tool to optimize profiles for the AI-driven job market.
