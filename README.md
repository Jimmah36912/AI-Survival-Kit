**Live Demo:** [https://ai-survival-kit-577388719652.us-central1.run.app](https://ai-survival-kit-577388719652.us-central1.run.app )  
**Built for:** Google AI "Build Your Portfolio" Challenge (2026)

## 🌟 The Mission
The AI Survival Kit is a mission-driven project designed to help workers at risk of AI job displacement. Built by a non-programmer, this project serves as a "Proof of Concept" that with the right tools, anyone can move from a place of fear to a place of empowerment.

## 🧠 My Journey: From “I Can’t Code” to “Wait… I Built That?”
Two weeks ago, I was watching AI headlines and thinking: *“Man… people are about to get blindsided.”* 

I’m not a programmer, but I’ve always been the type to learn fast when something matters. I went from asking *“What even is a terminal?”* to:
*   **Fighting with Docker:** Learning to containerize my mission for the cloud.
*   **Wiring up Gemini:** Integrating the `gemini-1.0-pro` model as a personal career coach.
*   **The Shipping Moment:** Seeing my project go live on a `.run.app` link. 

When it finally went live, I just sat there like… *Holy sh*t. This is real.* That’s what this kit is: a real build, from a real person, for real people.

## 🛠️ The Google Power Stack
I chose to centralize my entire stack within the Google ecosystem to avoid "subscription fatigue" and focus on impact:
*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro API:** The intelligent "brain" providing real-time career coaching and strategic guidance.
*   **Google AI Studio:** My prototyping lab for prompt engineering and model testing.
*   **Gemini Image Generation:** Even the cover image was created using Gemini. I took design concepts from AI collaborators, crafted the prompt,
*    and let Google's AI bring the vision to life. It felt right that a project about AI empowerment should be visually represented by AI itself.
*   **Google Cloud Run:** The serverless home for my Flask backend.
*   **Google Cloud Artifact Registry:** Secure container management.
*   **Google Cloud Build:** The automated deployment engine.
*   **Google Cloud Console & SDK:** My centralized dashboard and CLI.
*   **Google Fonts:** Utilizing 'Inter' and 'Roboto' for a clean UI.
*   **Google Chrome Extension API (V3):** Putting AI directly into the browser.


## ❤️ Why I Love the Google Ecosystem
What I appreciate most isn't just the power of the models—it's the **velocity**. The "Single Pane of Glass" experience across Google AI Studio and Cloud Run allowed me to stop worrying about the app's "plumbing" and focus 100% on the human mission. Google builds for the person who wants to move fast and solve real-world problems without the infrastructure overhead.

## 🚀 What's Next?
*   **Public Release:** Launching to a wider audience.
*   **Direct Download:** One-click install for the Chrome Extension.
*   **LinkedIn Analyzer:** A Gemini-powered tool to optimize profiles for the AI-driven job market.
*   **Backend API Integration:** Restoring full Gemini API connectivity after resolving Google Cloud authentication.
